# arduino-console
A minimal framework for adding a console to Arduino projects, allowing you to type simple commands and to print results. 

## Introduction

What I have often wanted for my projects is a simple console that would give me the ability to run simple commands, to perform configuration, or perhaps testing. Since I am old I rememner the old days when any piece of equipment with any pretensions to usability would have a 25 way D connector on the rear panel that would allow you to plug in a dumb terminal, and after learning some arcane command language, _interact_ with the equipment.
