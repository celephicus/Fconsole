Where Arduino stores local libraries. This is unlikely to be correct for you:) As a start, look in the Arduino preferences.txt file.
ARDUINO_LIBS_DIR = /mnt/c/Users/admin/My\ Documents/Arduino/libraries/

# What we call the library in Arduino-land. I'm not sure what to call it, so this allows it to be changed easily.
LIB_NAME = ArduinoConsole
